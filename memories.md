Whenever providing code solutions, this structured output format must be followed for suitable response:

## 1. What: Solution Overview
- Briefly summarize the final implementation.
- List all major **APIs, libraries, and internal functions** used.
- Also explain what **arguments** the **APIs , libraried and functions** take and why are they taken


## 2. Why: Architectural Reasoning
- Explain **why** these specific functions/APIs were chosen over alternatives.
- Justify the **code structure**.

## 3. How: Implementation Logic & Data Flow
- **Step-by-Step Logic**: Explain how the code works line-by-line or by logical block.
- **Data Flow**: Describe what data is used by code/api , how data enters the system, how it is transformed, and where it exits.
- Also explain how the **APIs,libraries and internal functions** are interconnected

## 4. Documentation & Best Practices
- Provide needed code with detailed inline comments.
- Highlight any security or performance considerations.
